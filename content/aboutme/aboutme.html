<h3>Academic History</h3>
<p>Originally I attended the Liberal Arts &amp; Science Academy (LASA) in north-east Austin for high school, were I became intrigued and inspired by the world of biology. Being active participant in the Robotics Club, I always thought I would go on to major in some field of engineering, though my eye was on Biomedical engineering. After taking a gap year where I volunteered abroad working in gardening, agriculture, and horticulture work I decided to start my major off in a more broad field so as to allow myself time and space to be exposed to wider variety of future possibilities. I’ve been blessed and cursed by the ability to become enthused by a broad range of subjects, but that has made it a bit difficult to narrow down my search. Fortunately I have a belief in how everything I learn, no matter the subject, somehow contributes to my accummulated knowledge and understanding of the world, or the process of understanding. For example, I enjoy tying in what I learn in philosophy and evolution to that of biology and psychology when trying to analyze patterns of history. In this way, I don’t think I’ve truly given up on any particular future, and can incorporate them in some manner or another. The engineering mindset that I developed in my earlier years has set me up to be successful in many ways because it taught me vital skills like team-work, problem solving, and allowed me to develop my creative side in a new way outside of the traditional music and art (that I also like to partake in).</p>
<p>Today, I’m a soon-to-be graduate from the University of Texas at Austin with a bachelors degree in biology, as well as neuroscience. I technically have two more classes to complete this summer to complete all the requirements, but after that I plan to gain lab experience on the UT Campus and find a part-time job for the next year as I study for the GRE and investigate the different graduate programs to which I would want to apply. If it were up to me, I would have added a third major in Psychology because I find the facets of the mind incredibly fascinating, but unfortunately due to the system’s limitations I was only able to make it my field of study and take 5 classes in that department.</p>
<p>Currently I am working with Kaelin Ruben Nguyen Rubenzer in Dr. Pierce’s lab on a project investigating various genes that may play a part in the social behaviors displayed by those with Autism by studying C. elegans since they display clear social behaviors and have a well mapped genome which can be manipulated to express or have different variants of targeted genes. Unfortunately I had not been able to work in the lab for very long before COVID-19 shut down campus, but I’m looking forward to returning and possibly expoloring other labs as well.</p>

<h3>Current Interests</h3>
<p>Being a student, the vast majority of my time is spent in lecture or studying, so most of my exposure and interests tend to stem from there. It’s a wonderful feeling though to be able to claim that I simply love learning and that I try to always study for the sake of the knowledge, rather than to get a letter grade. I’ll mention a few of my recent interests here:</p>
<p>One of them includes the topic of co-morbidity between mental illnesses and how it might be possible to use neurophysiological, genetic, environmental, and behavioral data to predict risk, onset, and better characterize developmental trajectories and outcomes in a particular disorder. This interest came about from a lecture I had specifically on the comorbidity rates of AUDs (Alcohol Use Disorders) and bioplar disorder. I’m very interested in the topic of bipolar disorder in general due to certain personal ties I have with it, and I believe what particularly peaked my interest was the professor’s discussion about its links, as well as those with mood disorders, to high risk of suicide. In a psychology class I took recently we also talked about the rate of suicide in the US and how it’s the 10th leading cuase of death in all ages, but also how it’s the second leading cause after unintentional injury in ages 10-14 years old, which I find appalling. I’m a huge advocate for mental health in general so this topic is pretty dear to me.</p>
<p>Another interest I had was in the use of transcriptome-based drug discovery or repurposing for addictions and other brain diseases. This idea comes from the hypothesis that the brain gene expression data from genetic rodent models of excessive drinking can be used to predict drugs that will reduce alcohol consumpsion. Essentially they determing the genomic signature of a disorder by finding a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between an alcoholic line and a normal mouse line. Then they identify compounds with signatures that have a negative connectivity to the disease signature to determine candidate drugs, which they then follow us with in vivo tests. This kind of technology would be invaluable because typically it takes so much time and money to discover/create new drugs for treatment, and many fail in their initial target goal, but by prepurposing the drug by finding its use in another fashion, more alternative treatments can be offered as well as saving money and energy that otherwise would have been for low payout. It’s a great idea because it can make our drug target treatments more efficient by finding compounds that are targeting mor genes, since genes tend to work together as a group to have a biological effect, and it may be amenable to personalized medicine in the future since it is good for heterogenous populations. I could go on and on, but I may in the future make more posts about these things.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I’m not always focused on science though. I enjoy various hobbies, but my main ones are baking, running, and photography. My sweet tooth knows no end so you can consistently find me in the kitchen trying out a new recipe and sharing the results with my friends (because I don’t need that much sugar in my diet xD). I am a novice runner, but I have an issue with consistency. I tend to treat running as a mental game and sometimes push myself too much as I’ve completed two half-marathons and one full marathon with minimal to no training, which has led to injuries that forced me to stop running for a good time after so I would 100% not recommend. My goal is to become consistent and maybe one day qualify for the boston marathon. But on the topic of photography, I recently inherited a camera from my older brother who is a cinematographer, so I’m slowly trying to step up my game and editing skills. If you’re curious to check out some of my older work, feel free to visit my viewbug accounts Kastar809 or BigPictureSmallWorld. I’ve taken a particular liking to macrophotography ever since I discovered lens whacking, but I hope to someday have enough money to purchase a legitamate macro lens.</p>
