      <description>About Me Academic History Originally I attended the Liberal Arts &amp;amp; Science Academy (LASA) in north-east Austin for high school, were I became intrigued and inspired by the world of biology. Being active participant in the Robotics Club, I always thought I would go on to major in some field of engineering, though my eye was on Biomedical engineering. After taking a gap year where I volunteered abroad working in gardening, agriculture, and horticulture work I decided to start my major off in a more broad field so as to allow myself time and space to be exposed to wider variety of future possibilities.</description>
